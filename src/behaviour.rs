//! Behaviour content fetching (ma-runtime-v1.md §14.2.2), and the
//! `#!/ipfs/<cid>`/`#!/ipns/<key>` reference resolver backing the
//! `ma_ipfs_include` host function (ma-scheme-v1.md §11.1).
//!
//! **The runtime performs no recursive expansion of any kind here.** An
//! earlier draft of this module scanned fetched behaviour text for `#!`
//! directive lines and spliced them in recursively, before ever handing
//! the result to a plugin's `set_behaviour` export. That mechanism has
//! been removed: multi-piece library composition is now entirely a
//! ma-scheme-level concern, handled by the dialect's own
//! `ma-include-ipfs` primitive, which calls `ma_ipfs_include` once per
//! reference it encounters and performs its own recursion/depth/cycle
//! tracking on the guest side (see `rust-ma-scheme-actor`'s
//! `src/include.rs`). This module is now a single, flat,
//! reference-to-bytes resolver — nothing more.
