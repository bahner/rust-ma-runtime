# How to run your own 間 runtime

This guide walks you through everything from a blank machine to a running
personal `ma` runtime with your own entities, reachable by others over the
peer-to-peer network.

---

## What you are setting up

`ma` is a personal daemon that gives you a permanent
[`did:ma:` identity](https://github.com/bahner/ma-spec) on the decentralised
web.  It acts as a bridge between browser-based actors (zion) and IPFS, and
hosts your own Wasm plugins — entities — that anyone with your DID can call.

The system has three moving parts:

| Component | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **IPFS Desktop** (Kubo) | Content-addressed storage; your DID document and all entity state live here |
| **`ma`** | The runtime daemon; derives your DID, hosts plugins, handles messages |
| **zion** | Browser-based actor terminal; how you talk to `ma` and to others |

---

## Step 1 — Install IPFS Desktop

IPFS Desktop bundles Kubo and a system-tray GUI. Download it from:

**<https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/>**

Install and launch it.  The tray icon will show a spinning animation while
it connects to the network, then settle to a steady icon once ready.

### Windows firewall prompt

On Windows, the first time Kubo starts you will get a Windows Defender
Firewall dialog asking whether to allow network access.  **Allow it** —
both private and public networks if you want full connectivity.

The daemon only binds to `127.0.0.1:5001` for its RPC API, so the only
practical network exposure is the libp2p swarm port (default 4001) which
is outbound-initiated and encrypted.  Running this on your own laptop or
desktop carries no meaningful risk.

---

## Step 2 — Install `ma`

Download the latest release binary for your platform from:

**<https://github.com/bahner/ma-runtime/releases>**

**Windows:** download `ma.exe`, place it anywhere (e.g. your Desktop or
`C:\Users\<you>\bin\`), and double-click it.  A terminal window opens and
`ma` starts.  No further setup is required.

**Linux (Ubuntu / Debian):** download the `ma` binary, make it executable,
and move it onto your `PATH`:

```sh
chmod +x ma
mv ma ~/.local/bin/
```

**macOS:** same as Linux.  You may need to right-click → Open the first time
to bypass the Gatekeeper quarantine warning.

Or build from source (requires Rust stable):

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/bahner/ma-runtime ma
```

---

## Step 3 — First start

**Windows:** double-click `ma.exe`.  A terminal window opens and the daemon
starts immediately.

**Linux / macOS:** run it from a terminal:

```sh
ma
```

On first start `ma` detects that no identity exists yet and automatically
generates a complete configuration — a fresh `did:ma:` identity, four
32-byte cryptographic keys, and a random passphrase to encrypt them.  The
passphrase is printed to stdout **once**:

```
Generated headless config.
Passphrase: correct-horse-battery-staple-...
```

**Save that passphrase.**  Store it in a password manager.

The passphrase is also written into `ma.yaml` automatically, so `ma` can
restart without prompting you.  If you prefer not to keep it in the config
file you can remove the `secret_bundle_passphrase:` line and supply it via
the environment variable `MA_SECRET_BUNDLE_PASSPHRASE` instead.

Config files land under your XDG config directory:

| OS | Path |
|----|------|
| Linux | `~/.config/ma/ma.yaml` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/ma/ma.yaml` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\ma\ma.yaml` |

### What happens at startup

`ma` will:

1. Derive its `did:ma:` identity from the IPNS key in the bundle.
2. Publish its own DID document to IPFS/IPNS (requires Kubo to be running).
3. Bootstrap a minimal empty manifest if no prior state is found in IPNS.
4. Start listening for iroh QUIC connections.
5. Start a local status HTTP server on `http://127.0.0.1:5003`.

You can visit **<http://127.0.0.1:5003>** in a browser at any time to see
your DID, endpoint ID, uptime, and loaded entities.

Machine-readable status:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:5003/status.json
```

---

## Step 4 — Open zion and claim your runtime

zion is the browser-based actor terminal.  Open it at:

**<https://zion.bahner.com>**

1. Create an identity (pick a username, set a passphrase).

   The username is **local only** — it never leaves your browser and is
   not part of your DID or published anywhere.  Your public identity is
   your `did:ma:…` key pair, which is cryptographically generated and
   contains no personal information.  You start out fully pseudonymous.

2. Claim ownership of your local runtime — this discovers it, connects,
   registers your zion identity as the owner, and persists the claim to
   `ma.yaml` in one step:

```
.my.ma:claim
```

That's it.  Your DID document is published to IPFS automatically as part
of the process — no separate publish step is needed.

Until claimed, `ma` runs with an **open ACL** — all principals may use
RPC, generic IPFS store, and DID-document publish.  This is intentional: it
means DID documents can be published immediately on a fresh runtime without any manual configuration.
Once you claim the runtime the ACL tightens.

### Why open before claiming?

Your DID document needs to reach IPFS before anyone can verify your
identity.  Without an open ACL on a fresh unclaimed runtime, zion could
not publish its DID document to `ma`, which means no one could call you —
a chicken-and-egg problem.  The open window is short and local-only (the
runtime is only reachable via iroh QUIC using your endpoint ID, which you
have not shared yet).

### Privacy and encryption

All messages between actors — `@alice hello` to `@bob`, RPC calls,
inbox replies — are **end-to-end encrypted** using X25519 key agreement.
The iroh QUIC transport layer adds a further layer of encryption in
transit.  Neither `ma` nor anyone on the network path can read message
content.

Secure messaging has been a design goal since day one.  The design follows
the principles of [DIDComm](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/)
— sender-authenticated, end-to-end encrypted messages rooted in
[W3C DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) identities — but does not
implement the DIDComm standard itself.  DIDComm mandates JSON-based
envelopes (JWM/JOSE); `ma` uses CBOR instead, which is leaner and faster
to parse.  DIDComm is transport-agnostic in principle but defines HTTPS
and WebSockets as its standard transports; `ma` uses iroh QUIC exclusively.
The security model is equivalent: messages are signed by the sender's DID
key and encrypted for the recipient's DID key.  Only the wire format
differs.

`ma` has not been independently audited.  For now, think of it as a toy
that is safe to play with — the cryptographic design is sound, but it has
not been reviewed by a third party.  For high-stakes use, wait for an
audit or use a tool that has already been through one.

Anonymity was not a design goal of `did:ma:`, but as a secret messenger
for everyday use it should be **good enough** — your DID is a
random-looking key string with no personally identifying information baked
in, your username is purely local, and you choose what you publish in your
DID document.  If you do not associate your DID with your real name
anywhere, there is nothing in the protocol that links them.

No guarantees are given though.  Metadata (who talks to whom, when, how
often) is visible to anyone who can observe iroh traffic, and if you
publish a DID document that contains your name or website you have made
that choice yourself.  For adversarial threat models, use a tool that was
designed for anonymity from the ground up.

---

## Step 5 — Back up your identity

Your zion identity (keys, config, aliases, inbox) lives in your browser's
IndexedDB.  If that browser profile is lost, your identity is gone — there
is no server-side recovery.

**Export your bundle immediately after claiming:**

```
.my.identity:export
```

This downloads an encrypted JSON file named `<username>.zion.json`.  The
bundle is protected by your zion passphrase — without it the file is
useless, so the passphrase is the only thing you must keep secret.

**Store the file somewhere safe** — a USB drive, a cloud folder, a
password manager's attachment, or another browser.  You can also export
from the landing page (click **Export** next to your username) and import
on another browser via the **Import** button.

A few important things to understand about identity portability:

- **One active session per browser tab** — each tab is one identity, but
  you can have multiple browsers or profiles each running a different identity.
- **Only one place should be actively publishing at a time.**  The bundle
  can exist in multiple browsers, but whichever session most recently
  published to IPNS is the one that will receive messages — IPNS is
  last-write-wins.
- **Re-export after significant changes** — aliases, inbox state, and
  config only live in the browser.  The IPFS-published DID document is
  durable, but your local annotation data is not.

---

## Step 6 — Aliases: how to stay sane

Every actor in the network has a `did:ma:` identifier that looks like:

```
did:ma:k51qzi5uqu5dgqn5qgzrx81y9x2e5sesg5lqhiz6uvn8lep1k4l10k03ndubmt
```

Nobody memorises these.  Aliases are how you work with them:

```
# Store an alias
.my.aliases.alice: did:ma:k51qzi5uqu5…

# Use it anywhere
@alice:ping
@alice:fortune
.my.inbox:filter @alice
```

Aliases are stored in your local `EgoConfig` (IndexedDB in your browser)
and are personal — they do not propagate to others.  Think of them as your
own contact list.

The `@ma` alias is created automatically by `.my.ma:claim`.  Add aliases
for everyone you interact with regularly.  Without aliases, long strings of
`did:ma:…` will fill your terminal and you will lose track of who is who.

---

## Step 7 — Share your address

Your DID is your permanent address.  Give it to others so they can call
your entities or send you messages.

```
.my.identity
```

prints your full DID.  You can also link people directly to your DID
document on the IPFS gateway:

```
https://ipfs.io/ipns/<your-ipns-id>
```

where `<your-ipns-id>` is the part after `did:ma:`.  For example:

```
did:ma:k51qzi5uqu5dgqn5…
           ↓
https://ipfs.io/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dgqn5…
```

You will get back a `bafy…` CID as confirmation when things are written to
IPFS — this is normal.  The `bafy…` prefix means DAG-CBOR (v1 CID); `Qm…`
means an older raw block.  You do not need to remember CIDs — they are
stored automatically.

---

## Step 8 — Bootstrap with kinds

Kinds define the protocol a plugin speaks — its API, host functions, and
whether it is stateful.  They live in the `RuntimeManifest` on IPFS and
are the contract that lets `ma` load and dispatch any plugin that conforms.

Before you can load entities you need kinds in your manifest.  The easiest
way is to bootstrap from `bootstrap.example.yaml` (already in the repo):

```sh
# Publish the manifest tree to IPFS, get back the root CID
ma --gen-root-cid bootstrap.example.yaml

# Output:
# bafyreiabc123…

# Set it as your runtime head
echo "root_cid: bafyreiabc123…" >> ~/.config/ma/ma.yaml
```

Then restart `ma` and it will load the kinds and entities from the new manifest.

The example bootstrap ships with these standard kinds out of the box:

| Kind | Protocol | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `root` | `/ma/python/root/0.0.1` | Entity lifecycle orchestrator |
| `counter` | `/ma/python/counter/0.0.1` | Atomic integer with `:get/:inc/:dec/:set` |
| `register` | `/ma/python/register/0.0.1` | Bijective key↔value map |
| `set` | `/ma/python/set/0.0.1` | Unordered unique-value collection |
| `fortune` | `/ma/python/actor/0.0.1` | Stateless-style Python handler (own Wasm via `behaviour`) |

Kinds are the most important architectural decision in your runtime.  A
kind defines the whole contract — changing a kind after entities use it is
a breaking change.  Design kinds to be stable and reusable; entities are
the cheap, disposable part.

---

## Step 9 — Load entities and talk to them

With a bootstrapped manifest, your runtime will have live entities.  Try
them from zion:

```
# Ping the scheduler (built-in native entity)
@ma:ping

# Get the current counter value
@ma#counter:get

# Increment it
@ma#counter:inc

# Ask for a fortune
@ma#fortune:handle_cast
```

Responses come back as CBOR and are displayed in the terminal.  `:ok`
replies render as green; `:error` replies as red.

---

## Step 10 — Write your own plugin

This is where it gets fun.

Plugins are [Extism](https://extism.org/) Wasm modules.  Extism is a
universal plug-in system: you write your plugin in whichever language you
prefer, compile it to Wasm, and the runtime loads it.  Official PDKs
(plug-in development kits) exist for
[Rust](https://github.com/extism/rust-pdk),
[Python](https://github.com/extism/python-pdk),
[Go](https://github.com/extism/go-pdk),
[JavaScript/TypeScript](https://github.com/extism/js-pdk),
[C/C++](https://github.com/extism/c-pdk),
[Zig](https://github.com/extism/zig-pdk),
[Java](https://github.com/extism/java-pdk),
[C#/.NET](https://github.com/extism/dotnet-pdk),
and more — see the [Extism docs](https://extism.org/docs/overview) for the
full list.

The simplest way to get started is Python using `extism-py`.  Here is a
minimal stateless plugin:

```python
import extism
import cbor2

@extism.import_fn("extism:host/user", "ma_reply")
def ma_reply(data: bytes) -> None: ...

@extism.plugin_fn
def handle_cast():
    raw = extism.input_bytes()
    msg = cbor2.loads(raw).get("msg", {})
    ma_reply(cbor2.dumps({
        "msg": msg,
        "content_type": "application/cbor",
        "content": cbor2.dumps([":ok", "hello from my plugin"]),
    }))
```

Build it:

```sh
# Install extism-py (once)
pip install extism

# Compile to Wasm
extism-py hello.py -o hello.wasm

# Publish to IPFS
ipfs add --quieter hello.wasm
# → bafkreixyz…
```

Create an `EntityNode` descriptor (`hello.json`):

```json
{
  "name": "hello",
  "kind": "/ma/stateless/python/0.0.1",
  "behaviour": { "/": "bafkreixyz…" },
  "owner": "did:ma:<your-did>",
  "acl": ""
}
```

Publish it and register it with your runtime:

```sh
# Publish the entity node
ipfs dag put --store-codec dag-cbor hello.json
# → bafyreiXXX…
```

Then from zion:

```
@ma:entities.hello: bafyreiXXX…
```

Your runtime fetches the node from IPFS, loads the Wasm, and the entity is
live.  Call it:

```
@ma#hello:handle_cast
```

### Adding a new kind

If your plugin needs host functions or a different API, define a kind first
in your bootstrap YAML:

```yaml
kinds:
  /my/greeter/0.0.1:
    api:
      - handle_cast
    host_functions:
      - ma_reply
      - ma_send
```

Re-bootstrap to publish the new kind:

```sh
ma --gen-root-cid my-bootstrap.yaml
```

Update `root_cid` in `ma.yaml` and restart.  Now you can create entities
with `kind: /my/greeter/0.0.1`.

The [ma-python](https://github.com/bahner/ma-python) repository has working
examples for counter, fortune, register, and set — all production
plugins used in the standard bootstrap.

If you want to understand the message types being exchanged under the hood
— content-types, wire format, inbox and RPC protocols — the
[ma-spec](https://github.com/bahner/ma-spec) repository has the full
specification.

---

## Calling someone else's runtime

Ask them for their DID (`.my.identity` in their zion prints it), then add
an alias manually:

```
# Store their DID as an alias
.my.aliases.sky: did:ma:k51…their-ipns…

# Call their fortune entity
@sky#fortune:handle_cast

# Send them a plain message
@sky hello there

# Send a chat message (ephemeral / real-time — not stored in inbox)
@sky:say hello there

# Send a third-person action (the classic IRC /me)
@sky:emote waves hello
```

They receive your message in their inbox, identified by your DID.  If they
have an alias for you, they see `@you`; otherwise they see the full
`did:ma:…`.  This is why aliases matter on both sides.

**`:say` and `:emote`** are the two essential interactive message types,
both well-established since IRC days.  `:say` sends an ephemeral chat
message — the receiver displays it immediately and is not expected to
archive it.  `:emote` sends a third-person action in the style of IRC
`/me`: if `@sky` runs `@you:emote waves hello`, you see
`* @sky waves hello`.  Both are always end-to-end encrypted.

> **Note:** Port 5003 is a local-only status interface — it must never be
> exposed to the internet.  There is no network-based discovery of other
> people's runtimes; DID exchange happens out-of-band (share your DID the
> same way you would share an email address).

## Troubleshooting

**`ma` exits immediately with "kubo RPC is not reachable"**
: IPFS Desktop is not running, or Kubo is still starting up.  Wait for
  the tray icon to stabilise and retry.

**DID document never appears on the gateway**
: Check that IPFS Desktop is connected to peers (tray menu → "Connected
  Peers" should be > 0).  IPNS propagation can take a few minutes on a
  fresh node.

**zion shows `claim-conflict`**
: The runtime is already claimed (owners list is non-empty).  Check
  `~/.config/ma/ma.yaml` for the `owners:` key.

**Entities not loading after bootstrap**
: Make sure `root_cid` in `ma.yaml` matches the CID printed by
  `--gen-root-cid`, and that Kubo is pinning it
  (`ipfs pin ls | grep <cid>`).

**Wasm plugin fails to load**
: Verify the `behaviour` CID is reachable: `ipfs cat <cid> | wc -c`.
  Ensure the kind referenced in the entity node exists in your manifest.
